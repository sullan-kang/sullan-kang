### Hi there, I'm Lana ðŸ‘‹

I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student in Computer Science and Urban Studies at McGill University. My passion revolves around Human-Computer Interaction with a focus on Geospatial Information and User Experience. I aspire to be a computer scientist who can make people's daily lives better. I dream of travelling around the world & making a super unique map too.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently contributing to an Open Source [urban sustainability dashboard](https://github.com/MSSI-urban/Sus) project from the McGill Sustainability Systems Initiative! For coursework, I am studying *[Algorithm Design](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2021-2022/courses/comp-360)*, *[Network Science](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2021-2022/courses/comp-599)*, *[Sustainable Residential Development](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2021-2022/courses/arch-517)*, and *[Integrated Management Essentials](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2021-2022/courses/intg-201)* this fall. I want to study more about cities, software and intelligent systems until I graduate in December 2022.

ðŸ’– Some of my favourite courses from the past are *[Programming Challenges](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2019-2020/courses/comp-321)* (Fall '19), *[Cities in the Modern World](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2019-2020/courses/geog-217)* (Winter '20), ***[Principles of Geospatial Web](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2019-2020/courses/geog-384)*** (Winter '20), and *[Software Design](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2020-2021/courses/comp-303)* (Fall '20)! They were all very engaging and helped me explore my interests. <3

With all this, at the moment I'm studying [React](https://github.com/sullan-kang/react-study) on the side. 
This GitHub also contains archive of my old [Android](https://github.com/sullan-kang/Quack) and [Web](https://github.com/sullan-kang/cs-mcgill-renovation) projects.

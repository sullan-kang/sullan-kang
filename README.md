### Hi there, I'm Lana ðŸ‘‹

I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student in Computer Science and Urban Studies at McGill University. My passion revolves around Human-Computer Interaction with a focus on Geospatial Information and User Experience. I aspire to be a computer scientist who can make people's daily lives better. I dream of travelling around the world & making a super unique map too.

At the moment I'm studying [React](https://github.com/sullan-kang/react-study) on the side. 
This GitHub also contains archive of my old [Android](https://github.com/sullan-kang/Quack) and [Web](https://github.com/sullan-kang/cs-mcgill-renovation) projects.

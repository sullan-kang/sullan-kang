### Hi there, I'm Lana ðŸ‘‹

I'm a graduate of Computer Science and Urban Studies program at McGill University. My passion revolves around Human-Computer Interaction with a focus on Geospatial Information and User Experience. I aspire to make people's daily lives better, and dream of travelling around the world & making a super unique map.

### Hi there, I'm Lana ðŸ‘‹

I'm a third-year undergraduate student in Computer Science and Urban Studies at McGill University. My passion revolves around Human-Computer Interaction with a focus on Geospatial Information and User Experience. I aspire to be a computer scientist who can make people's daily lives better. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building my [website](https://sullan-kang.github.io). Stay tuned!

ðŸŒ± This winter semester, Iâ€™m currently learning about [Theory of Computation](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2020-2021/courses/comp-330), [Database Systems](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2020-2021/courses/comp-421), [Socio-economic Applications of GIS](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2020-2021/courses/geog-307), and [Principles of Statistics](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2020-2021/courses/math-204).
- In the database class, I worked on a project about the COVID-19 vaccination record tracking. I designed the ER & Relational model and built the IBM DB2 database using SQL, as well as a Java command-line program for altering database information.
- In the GIS class, I am working on a research project about the rural-urban public transit connectivity using network analysis.

ðŸ“š Some of my favourite courses from the past are [Discrete Structures](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2018-2019/courses/math-240) (Winter 2019), [Programming Challenges](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2019-2020/courses/comp-321) (Fall 2019), [Cities in the Modern World](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2019-2020/courses/geog-217) (Winter 2020), [Principles of Geospatial Web](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2019-2020/courses/geog-384) (Winter 2020), [Software Design](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2020-2021/courses/comp-303) (Fall 2020), and [Fundamentals of Computer Graphics](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2020-2021/courses/comp-557) (Fall 2020).

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on an Open Source project about GIS, or a project that can benefit from GIS techniques âœ¨
